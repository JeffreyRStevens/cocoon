The goal of `{formatstats}` is to provide functions that flexibly format 
statistical output in a way that can be inserted into R Markdown documents. 
This is analogous to the
[`apa_print()`](https://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/reporting.html#statistical-models-and-tests)
functions in the [`{papaja}`](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) package, but 
functions in `{formatstats}` can print Markdown or LaTeX syntax. If your output 
document is a PDF, this doesn't matter. But if your output document is a Word
document (as required by many journal publishers), Markdown syntax generates
editable output instead of an image of output. 
The default style for statistical output follows [American
Psychological Association style](https://apastyle.apa.org/), but many
defaults can be over-ridden to flexibly format output.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{formatstats}` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JeffreyRStevens/formatstats")
```

## Example

For an example, we'll create a correlation from the `mtcars` data set.

```{r example}
library(formatstats)
(cars_corr <- cor.test(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp))
```

Now we can apply the `format_corr()` function to `cars_corr` to create a
Markdown-formatted character string for the statistical results. We can
embed this as inline R Markdown code to generate the results.

#### Code

``Fuel efficiency and engine displacement were highly correlated (`r knitr::inline_expr('format_corr(cars_corr)')`). ``

#### Output

Fuel efficiency and engine displacement were highly correlated
(`r format_corr(cars_corr)`).

### Control formatting

We can also alter the output to allow other formatting. For instance, we may not like APA's silly rule to remove leading zeros before a value that cannot exceed 1 (like correlations and p-values). And we may not want to include the confidence limits around the correlation coefficient. Finally, maybe we don't want the statistics labels to be italicized.

#### Code

``Fuel efficiency and engine displacement were highly correlated (`r knitr::inline_expr('format_corr(cars_corr, pzero = TRUE, ci = FALSE, italics = FALSE)')`). ``

#### Output

Fuel efficiency and engine displacement were highly correlated
(`r format_corr(cars_corr, pzero = TRUE, ci = FALSE, italics = FALSE)`).


## Formatting types

* Correlations (output from `cor.test()`, including Pearson's, Kendall's, and Spearman's correlations)
* Student t-tests and Wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank tests (output from `t.test()` and `wilcox.test()`, including one-sample, two-sample independent, and paired tests)
* Means and error (calculates from vector or uses vector of mean and error interval or mean, lower error limit, and upper error limit)
* P-values
* Bayes factors (output from BayesFactor objects or scalar number)
* Scientific notation
* Other numbers

* [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) - This package uses the `apa_print()` function to convert a number of R statistical objects into R Markdown output. However, it only outputs LaTeX syntax and only generates APA formatted output with minimal flexibility to alter the output.
* [apa](https://github.com/dgromer/apa) - This package also converts some R statistical objects to R Markdown output. While it allows other output format such as Markdown, it also only generates APA formatted output with minimal flexibility to alter the output.
