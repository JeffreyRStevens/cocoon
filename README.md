The goal of `{formatstats}` is to provide functions that flexibly format
statistical output in a way that can be inserted into R Markdown or
Quarto documents. This is analogous to the
[`apa_print()`](https://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/reporting.html#statistical-models-and-tests)
functions in the [`{papaja}`](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) package,
but functions in `{formatstats}` can print Markdown or LaTeX syntax. If
your output document is a PDF, this doesn’t matter. But if your output
document is a Word document (as required by many journal publishers),
Markdown syntax generates editable output instead of an image of output.
The default style for statistical output follows [American Psychological
Association style](https://apastyle.apa.org/), but many defaults can be
over-ridden to flexibly format output.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{formatstats}` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JeffreyRStevens/formatstats")
```

## Example

For an example, we’ll create a correlation from the `mtcars` data set.

``` r
library(formatstats)
(cars_corr <- cor.test(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp))
#> 
#>  Pearson's product-moment correlation
#> 
#> data:  mtcars$mpg and mtcars$disp
#> t = -8.7472, df = 30, p-value = 9.38e-10
#> alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
#> 95 percent confidence interval:
#>  -0.9233594 -0.7081376
#> sample estimates:
#>        cor 
#> -0.8475514
```

Now we can apply the `format_corr()` function to `cars_corr` to create a
Markdown-formatted character string for the statistical results. We can
embed this as inline R Markdown code to generate the results.

#### Code

`` Fuel efficiency and engine displacement were highly correlated (`r format_corr(cars_corr)`). ``

#### Output

Fuel efficiency and engine displacement were highly correlated (*r* =
-.85, 95% CI \[-0.92, -0.71\], *p* \< .001).

### Control formatting

We can also alter the output to allow other formatting. For instance, we
may not like APA’s silly rule to remove leading zeros before a value
that cannot exceed 1 (like correlations and p-values). And we may not
want to include the confidence limits around the correlation
coefficient. Finally, maybe we don’t want the statistics labels to be
italicized.

#### Code

`` Fuel efficiency and engine displacement were highly correlated (`r format_corr(cars_corr, pzero = TRUE, ci = FALSE, italics = FALSE)`). ``

#### Output

Fuel efficiency and engine displacement were highly correlated (r =
-0.85, p \< 0.001).

## Formatting types

- Correlations (output from `cor.test()`, including Pearson’s,
  Kendall’s, and Spearman’s correlations)
- Student t-tests and Wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank tests (output
  from `t.test()` and `wilcox.test()`, including one-sample, two-sample
  independent, and paired tests)
- Means and error (calculates from vector or uses vector of mean and
  error interval or mean, lower error limit, and upper error limit)
- P-values
- Bayes factors (output from BayesFactor objects or scalar number)
- Scientific notation
- Other numbers

- [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) - This package uses the
  `apa_print()` function to convert a number of R statistical objects
  into R Markdown output. However, it only outputs LaTeX syntax and only
  generates APA formatted output with minimal flexibility to alter the
  output.
- [apa](https://github.com/dgromer/apa) - This package also converts
  some R statistical objects to R Markdown output. While it allows other
  output format such as Markdown, it also only generates APA formatted
  output with minimal flexibility to alter the output.
